"""This package contains the WorkTree object.

Typical usage is:

 - Create a new worktree.

This create /path/to/work/.qi,

 - Go to /path/to/work/src/foo, find the "bar" project

Explore each parent directory until a ".qi" is found.
Use the parent directory as a work tree.
Build a WorkTree object from the work tree.
Parses the worktree so that WorkTree every buildable projects
(directories that contains a qibuild.manifest)

To find the "bar" project, look for a project named "bar" in
worktree.projects

Note: the .qi also contains a config file, so you can
have different configurations with different work trees if you need.
