Python3 compatibility
---------------------

* The code base is now Python2.7 and Python3 compatible

* Unfortunately, the behavior of ``qiBuild`` when run
  with Python3 is slightly different than when run
  with Python2. Here is what you should know.


The good parts
+++++++++++++++

* The Python3 version fixes a few bugs related to
  non-ASCII characters that would be quite harder to
  fix on Python2.

The bad parts
++++++++++++++

cmake
~~~~~

* Since ``py_run_cmd()`` uses ``Python2``, importing qibuild from
  ``py_run_cmd()`` no longer works.

* ``qi_create_python_ext`` and ``qi_swig_wrap_python`` only support python2,
  so using ``qipy`` with C++ Python extensions will not work

qipkg
~~~~~

* ``qipkg release-package`` uses ``Python3`` to compile the ``.py`` files,
  which is not good since the packages are meant to be
  deployed to a target that still uses ``Python2``
